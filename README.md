# Bank-Account

Here we have an Account class which will serve as our framework for creating account objects. This program contains the data and the functionality associated with a bank account.

Next, we have a main class called AccountMenu that will allow users to interact with the banking application by creating a new account, making deposits and withdrawels, create a PIN number and checking the account balance. This program was written using a a while loop and if statements.

The AccountATM is our other main class which operates similarly to the AccountMenu class except we implement a switch-case method inside the while loop.
